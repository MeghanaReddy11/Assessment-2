#Project Title
MyToken

#Solidity
A simple ERC-20 token contract written in Solidity for creating and managing tokens on a blockchain.

#Description
MyToken is a basic implementation of an ERC-20 token contract, allowing users to mint and burn tokens. The contract stores token balances in a mapping and updates the total supply accordingly. This contract can be used as a starting point for more complex token implementations.
